# Lusso Overdrive
###### Get a crunch and boost !

This guitar pedal is based on the Klon centaur and the well knwon green friend TS, adding a 2 band EQ for low pass and high pass filtering along with a two modes bypass using two relays and an PIC uC programmed in C++.

Feel free to make your own pedal, here you can find the schematic, pcb and gerber files ready to send into your favorite pcb manufacturer.
